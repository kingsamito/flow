## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the key folders and files:

  This folder contains individual **section components** assigned to each developer. Find your section file here and begin building.

- `src/components/Btn.jsx`  
  This is a **reusable button component** with default styles already applied. Use this across the application for consistency.

- `public/`  
  This folder holds static files such as the **project logo**.

- `App.jsx`  
  The main file is already set up with imports and renderings for each component/section. As you build, everything will display together here.
